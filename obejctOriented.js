// What is Object Oriented Programming?
// OOP is a programming Paradime!

// How We Can Thinks EveryThing as a Object?
// Everything which takes multiply properties to describe is an object as well.
// An integer Number Can be also an object Like 450.0000 [There is a integer part, floating part, negetive part, popsitive part, string value has been included. Thats why we can think a number as an object]

// Class is Just a template in OOP or Modern JS
